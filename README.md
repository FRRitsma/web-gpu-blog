Goal: 

Demonstrate how to save a model as an ONNX model and transfer it to a completely different framework, such as javascript.

This can then be used to perform client side inference.


save_resnet_as_onnx.py demonstrates how to convert a pytorch model to the onnx format
inference_on_onnx.py demonstrates how to use a saved onnx model to perform inference with
